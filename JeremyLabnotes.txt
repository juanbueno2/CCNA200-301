# Day 14 subnetting 

# for subnetting we cxan use the powers of 2 formula wich 2 is the numbers of bits borowwed 

# Formula 2 power of (bits amount) -2 

# DAY 15 VLSM  

# VLSM is the process of creating subnets with diferent sizes FLSM is the process of creating subnets in a fixed way 

# the way to create subnets with VLSM start from thge largest subnet to the smallest one 

# Day 16 vlans 

# lan is a single broadcast domain single broadcast domain is a group of devices that receive broadcast frame 

# router wont forward broadcast frame 

# switches recieve brodcast frame floaded to all of the ports except the one that received the broadcast frame 

# VLANS from 1 to 1005 exist in switches by defaults can not be deleted 

# day 17 part1  vlans lab 

# day 17 part 2 encapsulations and trunks port 

# traffic from multiple vlans can be allowed over a trunk link 

# vlan tagging switches will tag all vlan over the trunk port 

# ISL and 802.1q are the 2 protocol for trunking ISL is cisco propietary 802.1q is industry standard ISL is no longer used 

# 802.1q tag is inserted in a field between the ethernet header the tag is 4 bytes or 32 bit 

# 802.1q has a featured called the native vlan wich is vlan 1 by default 

# when a switch received a untagged frame it will asume it belongs to the native vlans 

# vlans can also be filter wich vlan will be allowed or not usinf the commands vlan allowed (vlan #) vlan except (all vlan except vlan #) vlan none will not allowed any vlan 

# the comand to change native vlan is switchport trunk native (vlan # ) 
# its always best practice to change vlan1 to a diferent vlan 

# Router on stic (ROA) is a name given to a type of intervlan routing that use only one phisical interface and diferent subinterface 

# Day 17 2 do this lab  

#  DAY 18 PART 3 lAB TO CHECK ON THIS LAB DO IT 

# day 18 part 3 do this lab 

# day 19 dtp and vtp cisco propietary protocol 

# DTP is a cisco propietary protocol that allows interfaces to negotiate trunks 

# for security considaration dtp should be disabled in all interfaces 

# a Swich port in dinamyc desirable will activate negotiate to form a trunk with other switches 

# a switch in dynamic auto will not actively try to form a trunk but just passible 

# static access measn a static port that belongs to a vlan wich doesnt change 

# a switch in dynamic auto will form trunk with the other switchs if the other switch is in dynamic desirable 

# a switch port in access mode will stop dtp from sending dtp frames 

# VTP allows to configure vlans on a central server switch 

# 3 vtp mode that switches operates server client and transparent 

# server mode switches can add modified or delete vlans 

# vtp advertisement are sent only on trunk ports 

# vtp client cannot add modified or delete vlans they just syncronized with the highest revision # 

# for switches to syncronize among devices they need to have the same domain name 

# switches in transparent mode doesn not participate in the vtp domain it have its own database it just forward vtp information if they are in the same domain 
 

# day 19 do the lab 

# day 20 stp 

# STP is a layer 2 protocol 

# classic stp is a industry standard protocol STP prevent layer 2 loops by placing the ports in blocking state 

# vtp enable hello bpdu out of avery interface avery 2 seconds 

# the switch with the lowest bridge ID is elected the root bridge 

# in the root bridge all ports are forwarding  

# for a tigh braker the mac addres is used the lowest mac addrest will brak the tigh

# all switches have 3267 as default ID 

# PVST run a different stp instance per vlan one interface could be forwarding in one vlan and blocking in the other 

# all interfaces in the root bridge are designated ports 

# when switch boots its a root bridge it will give its position up if it receives a higher BPDU wich mean the lowest  ID

# there is one root port on each switch except for the root bridge 

# the lowest port ID is the root Port 

# each port has a default number of 128 

# Day 20 analysing STP 

# the interface with the lowest root cost will become the root port 

# Maximun age for hello Bpdu 20 Seconds 

# Maximun Delays 15 seconds 

# Day 21 (2) STP (Spanning Tree )

# Blocking and forwarding are stable states 
 
# Listening and learning are transitioning state 

# none designated ports are in blocking states 

# interfaces in the blocking states does not send traffic but they do receive BPDU 

# only designated and root port enter in a forwarding state 

# learning state is 15 seconds by default 
# a interface in learning state only send and receive BPDU 

# root and desiganted port in a forwarding state when stable it sends and receive normal traffic 

# pvst is alder version to support ISL trunking encap PVST + is the newest Version 

# the max age start at 0 and then increase by 1 

# Portfast solve problems of spanning tree putting the port in forwarding state and the port doesnt have to fo through the listening and learning state 

# between listening learning and frowarding the port takes 30 seconds 

# Port fast on trunk ports doesnt take any effects because it has to be configure only on access ports 

# BPDU Guard prevent from loops from forming 

# root guard will not accept as a root bridge 

# lOOP GUARD prevents loops if the interface fails in one direction 

# Modern cisco swtiches run rpvst by default is modern version 

# stp runs by default but it doesnt guarantee that the traffic will run for teh optimal path 

# configuration needs to be done for optimal bath to elect the root bridge if we want optimal path most of the time is the a great idea to configure the core switch as root bridge 

# Day 22 Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP)  

# RSTP is much faster at converging and adaptation RSTP doiens load valance very well it runs only one instance per vlan 

# RSTP + is better it runs many instance per VLAN 

# MSTP also is superior runs Many instances per Vlan 

# RSTP use a handshake mechanism 

# RSTP serve the same purpose as STP blocking ports to void Loops 

# 3 primary ports role are root designated and none designated 

# Uplink fast functions are built on RSTP 

# Backbone fast is another feature built on RSTP 

# Uplink fast and Backbone fast needs to be configure for them to work there is no need to have a knoledge about it because is not part of the CCNA but check more on there in detils 


# Rstp distinguish between link types first is edge edge port are connected to host 

# Point to point Link type are used for direct connect switch to switch the other link types is share wich most likely is never used 

# Point to point link type work in full duplex mode 

# Share ports are conecteed to hubs wich work half duplex  holds are old technologies are not used   anymore 

# RSTP used negotiation process instead of timers it is a evolution of STP 

# For RSTP there are 3 types of negotiation compared to STP they are discarding learning and forwarding 

# day 22 RSTP Lab (Do it )

# Day 23 Etherchannel 

# Etherchannel allows you to group multiple phisicall interfaces into a single logical interfaces 

# Layer 2 etherchannel its a group of phisical interfaces that operates in a single logical interfaces 

# Layer 3 its a group of route ports that operate in a single logical port 

# in etherchannel STP will  treat all  of the   links   as  one 

# Etherchannel load balance based on flow by using diferent phisical interfaces 

# Pagp is a cisco propiearetary protocol that can be used only on cisco switch 

# Lacp its a industry estandard Protocol it dynamically create the channel just like pagp 

# LACP is  the prefered method to use for etherchannel 

# up to 8 links can be configured for etherchannel with pagp with LACP up to 16 but only 8 will be working 

# Desirable mode will active try to form a channel auto will form a etherchannel if the other port is active negotiating 

# instead of desirable lacp use active and passive modes 

# static etherchannel is configured with on mode only work on mode 

# with routed ports not layer to loops will be formed 

# to configured a routed port etherchannel use no switchport command first and then assign a IP Address at the port channel interface 

# on on create a static channel 

# active active create a lacp etherchannel passive passive doesnt create channel 

# day 23 etherchannel lab do it 

# DAY 24 Dynamic Routing 

# Dynamic routing involved configuring a routing protocol and the router will find the best path 

# the metric in dynamic routing it is used to determine the best path to the destination 

# Dinamic routing protocol can be devided in 2 main categorys IGP and EGP 

# within a organization to share information IGP is used to share information Betweeen AS EGP is used 

# OSPF is a IGP 

# there is only one type algorythm path vector there is also one protocol used in EGP wich is BGP 

# algorytm has to vector type Link State and Distance  vector 

# RIP and EIGRP are distance Vector Protocol 

#  OSPF and IS-IS Are Link State Protocol 

# distance Vector Protocol work by sharing the routing Table 

# Link state Rouitng Protocol create a maps on the network each router use the map to calculate the best route 

# Link state Routing Protocol is Faster than Distance vector 

# Lower Metric is considered Better 

# ECMP (Ecual Cost Multipath ) 

# ECMP can also used with static route for Load Balance 

# RIP use the simplest matric hop count all count as 1 hop 

# EIGRP use a calculation of Bandwith an delay the lowest Bandwith in the link is used 

# OSPF its metric is cost in bandwith 

# IS-IS also use cost 

# when the metric is diferent the administrative distance is used for the best route 

# the number on the left within the brackets is the AD the numbers on the right is the Metric

# for static route to be less prefered than a dynamic routing protocol the AD has to be higher 

# Rip and EIGRP use router by rumor 

# Day 24 Floating Static route 

# Day 25 RIP and EIGRP 

# RIP is a industrie protocol is Distance vector Protocol it use hops count Maximun hop counting is 15 

# RIP has 3 version 1 and 2 rip also have another version call evng 

# by default rip exchange routing table every 30 seconds 

# RIP v1 doesnt support VLSM or CIDR 

# Broadcast message are delivered to all devices network multicast network just deliver messages to the same devices that join the same multicast group only 

# the comand to advertise router is default-information originate 

# if conections are fat ethernet or Gig ethernet it doesnt Matter RIP trat them equaly as Hope count 

# EIGRP is the only protocol that does unequal cost Multipath 

#the 0 in the wildcard mask means they have to match the 1 doesnt 

# Day 25 EIGRP Lab do it 

# succesor is the lowest rout to the best destination the one with the lowest metric 

# feasible succesor is not the best route but a back up if a router feasivility is lower than the succesor feasivility it will be the best route check on this in  depth 

# EIGRP dosnt do unequal cost load balance 

# Day 26 OSPF Part 1 

# Basic Operation of OSPF 

# OSPF is a Link state routing Protocol 

# OSPF use shotterst path first algorithm there are 3 version of OSPF 

# OSPF V2 is use in IPV4 Networks Version 2 is Used in IPV6

# Router will Flooad LSA to all areas 

# LSA contains information of roiuter ID (RID) 

# LSA are floaded in all of the network until all routers receive a copy 

# OSPF Use areas to devide the network 

# in a large network single area the SPF algorithm Take More time to calculate 

# router with all interfaces connected in the same area are called internal router 

# Router conected in diferent areas are called ABRS 

# Routers conected to the backbone area are called backbone Router 

# a intererea route are routes in diferent areas 

# all areas should be contiguous 

# Passive interfaces will stop sending hello Packets 

# if the router does not have a loopback interfaces the highest interface will become the router ID (Check on this)

# Check on ASBR 

# Day 27 Part 2 OSPF 

# OSPF metric is cost call is calculate it in bandwith wich is the speed of the interface 

# check how ospf cost calculation is done 

# there are 3 ways to change the OSPF reference bandwith (Check on this)

# When routers becomes neighbors they start exchanging hello packets sending multicast packets 

# OSPF has a place in the packet header 

# For them to become neighbors they have to go through diferent Steps 

# the init state means the hello packet was received 

# the 2 ways state is the next step containing the RID if both routers meet the 2ways state they can start exchanging LSA 

# THE router with the Higher RID will become the Master the router with the lower RID will become the slave 

# LSA are send in LSU (Link State Update) 

# the reference bandwith can be modified with the autocost referecne bandwith command 

# defaults hello timers is OSPF 10 seconds and the dead timers 40 for ethernet for other conections is diferent 

# day 27 OSPF LAB (Do it)

# Day 28 OSPF Part 3 

# Phisical hardware can have problems and fails wich means phisical interfaces will have problems but not with loopback address they are logical interfaces 

# is always a good idea to configure loopback address 

# there 3 main OSPF types first is broadcast then FDDI the next is point to point type wich is enabled in ppp and HDLC the last interface type in nonebroadcast 


# broadcast are neble in thernet and fddi by default 

# with nonebroadcast type routers might have to be configure manually for routers to become neighbors 

# The router with highest Priority will become the OSPF DR 

# the router wiht highest ID become the DR 

# the command to change ospf Priority is OSPF priority Follow by the Priority number 

# a router that is not DR Can be assigned to be the DR by changing the Priority 

#  if a router interfaces Priority is changed to 0 the router can not become DR or BDR 

# when DR goes down BDR becomes a DR and a new election is held for the BDR 

# DRothers does not exchange LSA with others 

# in a Serial conection  point to point conection OSPF there is not DR or BDR there is no need because they form full adjacency 

#  on serial connection one side is DCE and the other is DTE  

# on cisco router the default encapsulation for Serial connections is HDLC 

# on cisco router you can also use PPP encapsulation 

# the command to configure encapsulation PPP is encapsulation ppp

# serial link does not use broadcast type because serial link does not support layer 2 

# Usually router becomes neighbor with no problem the area type has to match for 2 routers to become neighbors must be in the same area 

# For 2 routers to become OSPF neighbors the interface must be in the same subnet 

# the OSPF must not be shutdown 

# OSPF router must be unique to become Neigbors 

# OSPF password the routers will become Neigbors if the password is the same and also if the password is configured and authentication is enabled 

# the IP MTU setings has to match as well the default is 1500 if they dont match OSPF can become neighbors but it will not work properly 

# the OSPF network type Must MAtch 

# OSPF LSDB is made OF LSA there are 11 types of LSA one of them is the network LSA (Check on the others)

# Type of multiaccess networj is ethernet 

# Type 2 is the network LSA and is generated by the DR 

# Drothers can only stablish adjacency with DR and BDR 

# day 28 ospf lab ( do it )

# Day 29 FHRP 

# FHRP is used in case of the primary router fail the backup router will take over in a matter of seconds 

# FHRP routers have to negotiate their roles they send multicast packets 

# There are 3 types of FHRP one is HSRP 2 is VRRP and 3 is GLBP 

# there are 2 version of HSRP it supports IPV6 and groups 

 
# Check on Mac addres HSRP virtual MAC for Version 1 and Version 2

# For VRRP instead of active and Standby a Master and backup router is elected check on this also the Virtual Mac Address is diferent Compared to HSRP check on that 

#  HSRP is Cisco Propietary VRRP is open standard 

# GLLP load balance multiple routers in the same Subnet 

# in GLBP one AVG is elected one AVF and Multiple AVF check on this 

# Day 29 HSRP Configuration (Do it ) 

# Day 30 TCP UDP

# Layer 4 protocol provide transparent data trasnfer to the end host transport encapsulates with a layer 4 header 

# another function of layer 4 is to provide or not provide services 

# one of the services is reliable data transfer another services is error recovery next id data sequence one more is flow control 

# the above services are provided by TCP but not UDP 

# TCP is a conection oriented protocol the 2 host establish a connection before sending data 

# TCP provide Sequencing TCP provide flow control 

# TCP use the 3 ways handshakes 

# TCP use retransmission as well 

# UDP is not conection oriented is conectionless udp does not provide reliable communication it does not stablish conection to send data it use best effort 

# UDP does not provide flow control or Sequency 

# Applications like video an audio UDP is prefered 

# Day 30 Wirechark demo do it 

# Day 31 ipv6 Part 1 

# IPV6 is 128 bits  

# PV6 is written hexadecimal 

# the first half of the address is the network portion and the second half is the host 

# Leading 0 can be remove wich mean shortening the IPV6 replaing with double colon (:) 

# 0 can be shortened only once 

# Typically the usual prefix is 64 bits for IPV6 

# finding the ipv6 prefix of 64 is easy make the second half all 0 

# Day 31 IPV6 LAB (Do it )

# Day 32 IPV6 

# EUI (Extended unique Identifier) 

# /64 means 64 bits will be the network portion 64 bits will be the host portion the way to do it is to divide the mac address in half 

# global unicast ipv6 address are internet address they can be used on the internet and they are spected to be unique 

# the range start from 200: etc check on this 

# Link local address use fe80 

# Link local means the address is used in the same link local or same subnet wich mean is not routable to the internet one of the use is for routing protocol peering 

# OSPFV3 use link local address fopr network adjacency 

# they can be used for static route and NDP use link local for network discovery 

# Multicast address in IPV6 unicast is used fopr one to one comunication broadcast is used one to all multicast is used one for many 

# ipv6 used Multicast address of FF00:/8 for Multicast 

# IPV6 does not use broadcast but there is a way to send message to all devices using multicast 

# in IPV6 the all nodes multicast address can be used for Broadcast address check on this 

# interface local and link local are defined they dont need to be configured 

# Site local The packets can be forwarded by routers sjopuld be limited to a single location not forwarded over the LAN address FF05 

# Organization local multicast could be all subnet in the organization 

# Global wich use FF0E Not boundaries Provided to be routed over the network 

# anycast is one to one of many or one of multiple multiple routers are configure with the IPV6 address but add the anycast word 

# there is not specified range of address for anycast 

# unspecified IPV6 address are all 0 

# 127:1 is the loopback address for ipv6 

# ipv6 enable cause of a link local address 

# Site local multicast ipv6 Can be routed outside the local network 

# IPV6 DAY 32 IPV6 LAB do it 

# Check on inverting the 7 bits on IPV6 

#   Day 33 Part 3 

# Leading 0 Must Be removed 

# When using ipv6 letters should be used lower case 

# IPV6 Headers have fix side of 40 bytess chack on this 

# the version field is 4 bits in size 

# the trafic class field its 8 bits size is used for QOS

# The flow label filed is 20 bits in zise is u8sed to cherck the flow 

# the payload filed is 16 bits 

# the next header field is 4 bytes 

# the hop filed is 8 bits 

# last 2 field is the source and destination this field is 128 bit in size 

# NDP in IPV6 is the equivalent to arp fror IPV4 

# Solicited multicast is much better thanh broadcast check on this 

# since in ipv6 there is not arp table what use is a neighbor table 

# When using SLACC router use ra and rs message and then it create the address the command slacc autoconfig does not need the prefix 

# slaac is a standard funtion of ipv6 

# dnd allows if other devices are using a duplicated address 

# the devices use dad for network solitition and network advertisement 

# ipv6 routing works the same as ipv4 routing 

# 2 routing tables are separated ipv4 are enabled by default ipv6 is disabled 

# if ipv6 is disabled it will send and receive traffic but will not route anything 
# static routes is when the interface is identify in ipv6 you can use directly attached route 

# a fully specified route is when the ip and the interface is specified  

# always configure the AD higher than how the route was learned from for loating static route 

# with ipv6 the exit interface has to be expecified because with link local it doesnt know what the next hop is 

# DAY 33 PART 3 LAB IPV6 (Doit ) 

# Day 34 standard ACL 

# ACL can filter traffic based on source and destination also based on ports and protocols 

# ACL are configured in global configuration mode ACL are made of ACE 

# after the acl has been configured it must be applied to a interface otherwise it wont work interfaces are inbound or outbound 

# router process the ACE in order from top to bottom 

# if the packet match of the acl it will stop processing 

# implicit denied if the packet does not match any entry it will deny the packet 

# standar acl are bace on ip address only 
# there are 2 types of standard acl name and numbered 

# there are also extended acl wich based on protocols and more granular 

# standard acl match packet s only based on source ip address it doesnt check the destination 

# numbered acl use numbered like 1 2 etc 

# standard acl can use 1 and 99 and 1300 to 1999

# 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255. is the wilcard that match the any word 

# a remark is the description of the acl 

# show access list command display all kind of access list 

# show ip access list show only ip access list 

# standard acl should be applied to as close as the destination as possible if you dont that you might block more traffic than spected 

# Day 34 standard ACL LAB (Do it) 

# Day 35 extended ACL 

# ip access list resequence will help to edit ACL 

# extended ACL is the same as standard ACL just you can named or numbered they are more precise and more complex 

# extended acl should be apply as close to the source as posible the oposite of extandard ACL 

# Day 35 extended ACL lab do it 

# Day 36 Laye 2 discovery protocol cdp and lldp 

# cdp is a cisco propieretary protoccol is enabled my default 

# cdp use multicast message is not send to multiple devices messages are sent every 60 seconds only directly connected devices can become neigbors 

# show cdp traffic commands will show how many messages has been sent or received 

# cdp run or no cdp run to enable or disable it globally 

# LLDP is industry standard is disabled by default LLDP messages are periodically sent to multicast address 

# only directly connected devices can become neighbors 

# to enable globally use lldp run to disable use no lldp run 

# to enable transmission use lldp transmit but it wan receive it will discard to enable receive use lldp receive command

# the command lldp reinit will allow reinitilization timer 

# show lldp neighbor table is the command to show neighbor tables 

# Day 36 CCDP and LDP Lab Do it 

# Day 37 NTP 

# Why time is important all devices have a internal clock to see it you can use show clock command

# the clock detail command will show the time source 

# the asterisk means the time is not authoritative 

# clock summer time is the command to configure summer time in cisco devices 

# ntp allows automatically time synchronisation to a NTP server 

# NTP client request time from NTP server NTP server can be client to the distance for a reference clock  is stratum 

# stratum 15 is the maximun anything above that is considered not relialable 

# NTP servers can be client and symetric mode as well 

# the command to configure NTP server is NTP server followed by the ip of the server 

# you can add prefered command to make the serve rthe prefered NTP server 

# NTP use the only ETC time

# command to configure a NTP master server is NTP Master 

# clock read calendar command will adjust the software clock to read hardware device 

# Day 37 ntp LAB (Do it)
# Day 38 DNS 
# DNS is used to resolved human readable name converting from iP address to domain name 
# Cisco router can act as DNS Server and Client 

# Devices will save queries in DNS Cache 

# Cname is a canonical record that map fron a name to another name 

# Day 38 DNS Lab (Do it)

# Day 39 DHCP 

# DHCP ack messages can be multicast or broadcast check on this 

# DHCP DORA check on this 

# Boradcast message doesnt leave local network for this a DHCP Relay can be configure in this case a router acting as DHCP Realy 

# Day 39 DHCP Lab (Do it)


# named acl are still standard acl but they are identified with a name 

# Day 40 SNMP 

# SNMP industry standard framework protocol 

# SNMP can be used to monitor network router and switches 

# NMS is a network server monitor that can be used to monitor Network devices 

# SNMP object ID are organized in a hierarchical way 

# snmp v3 is more secure that support encryption 

# there are 2 type of SNMP messages TRap and inform trap messages is a notification sent from the agent to the manager 

# snmp USE udp ther is not tcp retansmission 

# the inform message is like trap messages but with inform response 

# snmp message listen to message in port 161 and snmp managers listen to message to port 162 

# SNMMP V1 and V2 there is not encryption messages are sent in plain texzt 

# SNMP manager is the software that interact with SNMP Manager 

# SNMP Trap are messages sent by the manage device 

# Day 40 SNMP Lab do it 

# Day 41 syslog 

# Log messages can be shown in real time when it happens and it can be stored as well 

# login to the vty line is disabled no message will be displayed 

# the next location of the message is the buffer 

# Having a central server for syslog server is better for syslog analisys 

# the command is login console follow by the level number 

# check on syslog loggin configuration 

# for message to be display you have to use the command terminal monitor syslog will be display after logout the session wwill be finish 

# to prevent that you should use the login syschronys if the tipyng is interrupted by the message 

# Make sure you know the severity levels 

# Day 42 ssh 

# Layer 2 switch does not route packets but you can connect to them using ssh via SVI 

# to configure console line you can use configure console 0 only one user at the time can access

# login local tells the user to use one of the password configure in the device 

# Layer 2 devices only porpuse is to forward packets

# Transport input telnet allow only telnet transport input ssh allows only ssh transport input all allows all conection 

# Day 42 SSH LAB Do it 

# Day 43 FTP TFTP 

# The most common use for FTP and TFTP is to upload a OS image to the device also it can be 

# TFTP use UDP 69 

# SNMP use UDP does not use TCP 

# Day 44 NAT 

# Nat isn used to translate the source or a destination IP address 

# Before migrating everything to IPV6 one of the solutions is to use CIDR Private IP and NAT 

# Private IP Address cannot be used over the internet is were NAT comes into Play 

# Static Source NAT static Nat involve configuring one to one NAT 

# Inside Local Address is the address configured in the PC inside Global is the IP configured in the router 

# Outside Global is the IP configured on the other Router outside Local is the IP configured on the otherside of the Network PC 

# Day 44 Static NAT LAB (DO it)

# Day 45 NAT Part 2 

# Dynamic NAT a NAT pool is created to translate from one Public IP to Multiple Private PAT 

# if the source ip is not allowed in the ACL it doesnt mean the Packet will be dropped it means the IP will not be translated 

# PAT known as NAT overload tranlate the port number using ports a single ip address can be use by using multiple internal host 

# the router will use unique Ports Flows 

# when doing PAT you should trnslate to the external in this case the public ip Address 

# Day 45 Dinamic NAT and PAT Doit 

# Day 46 QOS 

# Traditional phone operates over PSTN modern phones operates over VOIP 

# another name for access port is untagged port 

# trunk port carry vlans for multiple devices 

# POE aaloow PSE equipment to provide power to devices this devices are switches 

# PSE receive AC power and convert it to DC power 

# Power policing prevents a POE to take to much power Check on this  

# POE originaly was not POE it was Cisco inline Power 

# Jitter will affect audio quality of the phone 

# if the message are sent in a interface faster it could place the packets differently thats why they are put in a que 

# if the que id full packet is drop this called tail drop 

# Network Congestion Leads to network Drop 

# A solution to prevent tail drop is random early detection 

# WRED allows you to see wich packets are dropped 

# Day 46 Voice VLAN do it 

# Day 47 QOS PART 2 

# Clasification gives priority Totraffic over others 

# Classification is fundamental to QOS 

# NBAR perform a deep packet inspection beyond TCP all the way up to layer 7 

# pcp field is in the trunk is refered as COS 

# in the ipv4 Header there is a byte called TOS type of service 

# Standard IPP marking is Similar to ppc 

# DF default forwarding is the marking for Best Effort 

# EF expedited forwarding is for required low loss 

# AF Asure Forwarding highest packets will be forwareded compared to low packets 

# Low Latency Queing create a priority Que 

# Day 47 QOS LAB DO it 

# Day 48 Security Fundamental 

# CIA Triad confidentiality Integrity and Availibility 

#  One common DOS atack is the tcp Sync Flood 

# Techniques Mitigation involved acroos all devices Firewalls Computers Routers and switchs 

# In a ddos Atack the Attacker sends multyple sync packets to infect with Malware 

# In a reflection attack the attacker spoofed the address to a reflector 

# a amplification attack is when the amount of traffic that is sent is small 


 # Man in the Middle attack the attacker place himself in the middle between the source ans destination 

# AAA is a framework that stands for authentication authorization and account it will monitor network users to have access to resources 

# Authentication the process of verifying a users identity 

# Autherization is granting the user the proper access and permission 

# Accounting is the process of recopnrding users activity on the system 

# ISE is cisco AAA Server 

# Radius is a standard protocol and use port 1812 and 1813 

# Tacas + is a cisco propietary protocol 

# Users awareness Programs this are design to make user aware of potential risk 

# Day 48 Kali Linux LAB Do it 

# Day 49 port security 

# port security allows mac address 

# Port security is a feature of cisco switches it allows what mac addres are entering

# if a frame with a unautorized states enter the switch it will take a action one of the common one is to place the interface in a error disable state traffic will not longer sent or receive on that interface 

# port security is benefitial when controlling wich mac address is allowed and how many mac address is allowed 

# Secure up means the port is enabled and up 

# if you configue the aging time it means its absolute what it means is it will start counting and when the time expired it will remove themac address from the violation 

# Day 49 port security LAB Do it 

# Day 50 DHCP Snooping 

# dhcp snooping is a security features for switches that filtered dhcp messages on untrusted ports 

# all ports are untrusted by default is them up to us to make them trusted 

# usuallly uplink ports are configured as trusted ports means from the access switch to distribution or core 
# downlink ports are configured as untrsted ports means access switches ports were devices are connected 
#DHCP Snooping wont inspenct any messages in trusted ports the switch will forward them as normal 

# DHCP starvation in this type of attack the attacker use spoofed MAC address the purpose is to get the DHCP table full  

# DHCP poisoning can perfomr a man in the middle attack 

# message receive on trsted port will not be drop 

# when messages are received in untrusted port if the packets match forward it if it dont discard it 

# when DHCP is enabled the DHCP will create new DHCP binding table 

# DHCP snooping needs to be enabled globally and then in each VLAN 

# rate Limiting DHCP Snopping can limit rate in wich the packets enters a interface 

# if the rate crossed the configure limit the interface will go into error disable  mode 

# dhcp rate limiting can be usefull DHCP exostion attack 

# Day 50 DHCP Snooping lab do it 

# Day 51 Dynamic arp inspection 

# arp is used to learn mac address to a known ip address device it consist in 2 message send an reply 

# DAI is a feature of switchs to filter arp messages in untrusted ports it only filters arp messages  

# just like port security uplink are trusted ports and download links are untrusted 

# arp poisoning involved a attacker manypulating arp tables this is where DAI inspection comes 

# DAI operation are usually reliant on DHCP Snooping 

# DAI only have to be enabled per VLAN 

# DAI can be configured base on IP source mac and destination mac 

# day 51 DAI lab do it 

# Day 52 Lan Architectures 

# all PC connected to a central devices is a star topology 

# full mesh is when each devices are connected to each other this a full mesh topology 

# Partial mesh is when devices are not all interconnected 

# 2 tier design is called a colapse core design 

# access layer is when devices conected too QOS marking is done in there Security policies are performed in there too distribution layer agragate connectios from the access layer 

# in a tier 2 design the destribution switch is also the core switch 

# Traditionally 3 tier design are core distribution and access 

# spine leaf architecture is also called the CLO Design in the spine leaf architecture leaf switches ar connected to leaf switches spine switches does not connect to spine switches same thing for leaf switches 

# connections from distribution to access are layer 2 connections like spanning tree connections from distribution to cor eare layer 3 connections

# SOHO network have only one devices and does not need complicated Architecture 

# for small network there is not need to have dedicated devices for LAN or wireless one devices do everything 

# Day 52 HSRP and STP Syncronisation LAB Doit 

# Day 53 wan architecture 

# wan extend networks over geographical area like cities 

# hub and spoke the central site is called the hub the branches connected are called the spoke traffic can be control wich one can enter and can not 

# to send traffic between sites the conpany will create VPN 

# leased line is a dedicated phisicall link between sites that use ppp or HDLC dor encapsulation 

# Leased line standard beguint from T1 to T3 in europe it start from E1 to E3 

# MPLS are shared networks the label switching allows VPN to separeated traffic between router 

# CE mean costumer routers PE routers are provider router and the P router form connections but doesnt connect to the costumer router 

# MPLS lavel use MPLS label to decide where to send the router 

# when forming LAYER 3 VPN in MPLS a routing protocol can be used or a static route can be set between the CE and PE 

# When using LAYER 2 VPN the connection will be transparent to the costumer 

# MPLS Technology runs in the service Provider Network 

# site to site vpn is a vpn between 2 devices and is used to connect 2 sites a vpn tunnel is created by encapsulating the IP Packet header and a new header 

# check on the IPSEC encapsulation and deencapsulation process

# IPSEC does not support broadcast or Multicast 

# GRE creates tunnel like IPSEC but it does not encrypt the original packet so its not secured but it encapsulated broadcast and multicast 

# DMVPN is a cisco develop product that allows you to create a full mesh VPN 

# remote to site VPN use TLS 

# VPN Client software like cisco anyconnect are installed on end devices then the end devices create a tunnel to the remote device 

# GRE Tunnels Day 53 Lab Do it 

# Day 54 Virtualization and Cloud 

# Type 1 hypervisor is the hypervisor that is installed in the baremetal type 2 hypervisor is the one installed on the OS is a hosted hypervisor 

# three main cloud infrastructure are software as as a service (Saas) costumer does not managed this type of service the service provider is in control of everything


#  in platform as a service (Paas) the costumer only controls the development application the service provider control the rest 

# in IaaS (Infrastructure as a service) the costumer have control of everything the service provider take control of the phisical datacenter wich is the underlying infrastructure 

# 4 deployments model of cloud are the following Private cloud , community cloud , Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud 

# Day 54 Containers 

# VM allows to install multiple OS and then install the Apps in it 

# Containers run on containers engine and the container run in the OS in this case Linux 

# kubernetes is a container orchastrator for docker we have docker swm 

# Day 54 VRF 

# VRF Allows you to devide one phisical router into multiple Routers 

# VRF devide one router into Multiple  virtual router with its own Routing Table 

# Traffic in one VRF cannot be configured to forward traffic to another VRF VRF is configured to facilitate MPLS 

# VRF lite is withouth MPLS 

# withouth VRF same subnets will overlap but with VRF it wont
